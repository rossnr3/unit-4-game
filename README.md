# Crystals Collector Game

### Overview

Crystals Collector is a random number guessing game. When the game begins, 
there are four crystals displayed on the page, and a random **Target** number.

Each crystal has been assigned a unique random number. The player must select
a crystal, and the unique number is added to the player's score. The player
wins the game if their score matches the target number. If the player's score
exceeds the target number, they lose.

The game restarts when the player wins or loses, and a running score of wins
and losses is kept.

The game is intended purely for entertainment.
